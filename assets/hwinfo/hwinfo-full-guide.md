All 3 programs need to be running for at least 10 minutes, or until your PC crashes. Start the timer after you get furmark running for the best results. Ensure the Furmark window is on top, and **do not use your computer** during the 10 minutes.

If you are getting help from the discord, you can just upload the .csv file directly to discord.

If you are getting help from the reddit, or the CSV file is too large for discord, upload the csv to [https://www.catbox.moe/](https://www.mediafire.com/)
