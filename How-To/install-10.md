# Installing Windows 10
**Warning**: All files on the drive you plan to install Windows to will be **deleted** if you follow this guide - this is intended. Please ensure you have an adequate [backup policy](https://rtech.support/books/backups) in place before proceeding if you have files of value.

1. Using a USB flash drive **at least 8 gigabytes in size**, create a bootable USB flash drive using the [Media Creation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) from Microsoft. This will also wipe any data stored on the USB flash drive.

>It is best to disconnect all storage disks except from the main (C Drive) disk from the computer before installing Windows 10.

2. Boot into your USB that has the Windows 10 Media on it. 
	
	* *You can do this by entering your systems' BIOS and change the BIOS boot order to have USB media as the first priority (this can usually be found under the boot tab), or simply look for the words "boot menu" when you see your BIOS boot screen, press the corresponding function key and choose the USB flash drive to boot from it.*
    
3. Follow the steps on screen to install Windows 10.

5. Continue on until you hit the license key screen. Here you can either enter your license code or, if Windows has been installed to this computer before, click on the "I don't have a product key" link.

7. Click on each partition of the target drive and select delete. ***Each means ALL*** But do you mean ALL? ***Yes, All***. Once all the partitions are gone you will be left with unallocated space. At this point click next.
