# rTechsupport Wiki
Why move the wiki?
* Fewer permissions to manage
  * Anyone can PR changes while BookStack relies on an admin granting proper permissions that may be too limiting for testing purposes 
* Increasing the bus factor from 1 
  * The VPS that runs BookStack is controlled by and visible to one user
  * GH can be forked, the data is plain text
* Better article formatting
  * BookStack has comically bad markdown support as evidence by the many dozens of spaces, `<br>`s, and other hacks required for formatting some articles
* Possibly a better layout
