# Securing Data When Selling
<why do this>

## Wiping the drive
Use [our guides](/docs/disks/disk-wipe) to wipe the particular type of storage in your device before selling.

## Just Keep the Drive
If you do not trust the process of the previous two methods, you can always keep the drive in a secure location. Keeping the drive ensures that your data will not fall into the hands of other people.
