# Securing Data When Selling
This guide is how to secure your data when selling your computer.

## Wiping the drive
Using our guides to wipe the type of storage drives before selling. [HDD](/docs/disks/disk-wipe#hdd), [SSD](/docs/disks/disk-wipe.html#ssd), [NVMe SSD](/docs/disks/disk-wipe.html#nvme-ssd)

## Smash it
If you do not want your data at all to fall into the hands of someone else, then smashing the drive with an object to ensure that the data is not obtainable. 
This can be done by taking a hammer to it, or something that is heavy enough to break it to pieces. In the case of a hdd you want to make sure you get the actual disk prat that is on the inside. 

## Just Keep the Drive
If you do not trust the process of the previous two methods, you can always keep the drive in a secure location. Keeping the drive ensures that your data will not fall into the hands of other people.
