# Password Managers

## Prelude
Early in 2019, Basecamp and Nest sent out a notifications that mass break-ins had occurred against their users. It was not because they had a breach, it was not their fault at all. The mass break-ins were the result of a botnet campaign that was using credentials farmed from other breached companies. 

Many people use their passwords in multiple places, so when an account is found those credentials can be smashed against every other site on the internet, and the odds say that the credentials will work in multiple other places. Breaches are very common, and often go unnoticed for years, there are several instances of companies only finding out they were breached once the FBI notifies them that their password dumps were found.

A great site to visit, you can enter  your email and haveibeenpwned will tell you how many breaches it has been exposed in. The site will also tell you what was exposed in that breach such as passwords, names, addresses, social security numbers, and other PII that you care about. Just looking at the front page of haveibeenpwned shows the magnitude of data breaches today. The current count of compromised accounts held by the site is close to 12 billion.

### Collection #1
In January 2019, a large collection of credentials was discovered being distributed on a popular hacking forum. The data contained almost 2.7 billion records including 773 million unique email addresses alongside passwords those addresses had been used on other breached services.

### Verifcations.io
In February 2019, an email validation service called verifications.io suffered a data breach. The breach was due to the data being stored in a  database that was left publicly facing without a password and resulted in 763 million unique email addresses being exposed. Many records within the data also included additional personal attributes such as names, phone numbers, IP addresses, dates of birth and genders. No passwords were included in the data. 

## What can we do?
### Unique passwords, every site, every time
The first step is minimizing the impact of an account that has the password stolen, that event is inevitable. You can do this by ensuring that all sites use unique passwords, 

> “But I will never remember that many passwords", you don't need to. 

I have over 450 sets of credentials and remember 6, the key is writing them down. Yes, Writing down passwords is OK.

There is an asterisk there of course, it is OK to write down passwords if they are secured. A notebook in a locked cabinet is fine, a sticky note on your monitor is not. We are in the modern age though, so we don't use notebooks, we use password mangers. 

### Password managers
A password manager is a piece of software that holds all your other credentials in a heavily encrypted box. You just need to keep track of the one master password. 

These all will have browser extensions and mobile apps, they auto fill everything and make life so much easier. I never have to remember, or type out long passwords.
