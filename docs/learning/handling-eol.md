# How to resolve an EOL OS

> We do not recommend in place upgrades from one OS to another, therefore in this guide we only link guides for clean installs.

An OS can be EOL for a number of reasons as outlined [here](/docs/meta/supported-os#no-support), how to deal with that EOL OS depends on the specifics of the OS in use.

## Windows 7
Upgrade to [Windows 10](/docs/installations/install-10), or switch to [Linux](/docs/installations/install-linux).

## Windows 8
Upgrade to Windows 8.1 (This EOLs in January 2023), [Windows 10](/docs/installations/install-10), or switch to [Linux](/docs/installations/install-linux).

## Windows 10 versions that are EOL
Force the upgrade to a stable version using the [Upgrade Tool available from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10), or upgrade to [Windows 11](/docs/installations/install-11).

## Windows 11 versions that are EOL
Force the upgrade to a stable version using the [Upgrade Tool available from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11).

## Linux
If the EOL version is less than older than the current version, then an in-place upgrade is probably fine. However, if it is older than that, a clean install is recommended.
